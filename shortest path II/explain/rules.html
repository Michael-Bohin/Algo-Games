        <p style="width: 90%; position:relative; left:5%;">Your goal is to find the cheapest path out of 6 possible different combinations and calculate its total price. There are two different views – satelite map and graph of flights. You can toggle between them by clicking on buttons or using hotkeys ‘s’ and ‘f’.</p>
        <p style="width: 90%; position:relative; left:5%;"> To view different paths separately you can either click on stars representing the city that the path contains or use hotkeys on numpad 1 through 6. Hotkey ‘0’ resets the view to display all paths, but without their distances. To view distances only from one city you can hover with mouse over its star. </p>
        <p style="width: 90%; position:relative; left:5%;">Once you have the answer fill it in the graph of flights and click on check answer. </p>
        <p style="width: 90%; position:relative; left:5%; text-align: center;">Good luck!</p>
